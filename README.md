**ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation Analysis Project ðŸš€**

Objective:
The main purpose of this project is to analyze customer data and segment customers based on their transactional behavior and demographic information. By grouping customers into meaningful segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, offer personalized promotions, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

**Key Components:**
1. Dashboard for Stakeholders:
The project features a well-structured and informative dashboard, designed to assist business managers and marketing teams in making data-driven decisions. Key insights include:

Customer Demographics: Visual breakdown of customer gender and city.
Coupon Usage: Trends in coupon transactions over time (claimed vs. burned).
Top-performing Cities/Branches: Cities or branches with the highest number of successful coupon burns.
Customer Retention & Loyalty: Patterns in coupon usage frequency and customer engagement.
Visualizations used:

Pie Charts: Displaying customer distribution by gender.
Bar Charts: Showing customer distribution across cities and coupon burn performance by branch.
Time-Series Line Charts: Illustrating coupon transaction status over time.
Scatter Plots: Representing customer clusters and their transactional behaviors.
2. Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning:
In the second part of the project, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to segment customers. The focus is on identifying distinct groups of customers based on both transactional and demographic data, to help businesses personalize their offers.

**Steps followed:**

Feature Selection: Using customer features such as transaction frequency, coupon usage, city, and gender.
Clustering Model: We implemented K-Means Clustering, exploring different cluster sizes to find the optimal number of segments.
Model Evaluation: We used evaluation metrics like Silhouette Score and Inertia to assess the quality of the clusters.
Analysis of Segments: Each customer segment is analyzed to understand their engagement and behaviors, with recommendations provided on how to enhance customer loyalty for each segment.
Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Plotly for interactive 3D visualizations.
Scikit-Learn for clustering (K-Means) and feature scaling.

**Results & Insights:**
The dashboard highlights important trends in customer behavior, such as top-performing cities for coupon burns and the most engaged customer segments.
The customer segmentation model revealed key groups, with actionable insights on which segments should receive personalized offers to increase their coupon usage and overall satisfaction.
Next Steps:
Further optimization of clustering using advanced techniques like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
Integration of new features like purchase amounts and frequency to refine customer segmentation.
Automating the dashboard for real-time insights.
