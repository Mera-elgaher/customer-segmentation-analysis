**Customer Data Analysis and Segmentation**

This project involves analyzing customer data and performing customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. The project consists of two main parts: creating a dashboard for stakeholders and implementing customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. Below is a detailed description of each part, including code and visualizations.

**Part 1: Dashboard for Stakeholders**

Objective
Design and develop a well-structured and informative dashboard that presents key insights from the dataset. This dashboard is designed for stakeholders such as business managers and marketing teams to help them make data-driven decisions.

Visualizations
Customer Demographics

Gender Distribution: Pie chart showing the distribution of customers by gender.
City Distribution: Bar chart showing the distribution of customers by city.
Coupon Usage

Transaction Status Over Time: Line chart showing the status of coupon transactions (e.g., claimed vs. burned) over time.
Top-performing Cities/Branches

Top Cities by Number of Burned Coupons: Bar chart showing cities with the highest number of burned coupons.
Top Branches by Number of Burned Coupons: Bar chart showing branches with the highest number of burned coupons.
Customer Retention and Loyalty

Distribution of Customers Across Clusters: Bar chart showing the distribution of customers across different clusters.

**Part 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning**
Objective
Develop and train an unsupervised machine learning model to segment customers based on their transactional behavior and other relevant features. Identify customer groups with similar behaviors and use these segments to discuss strategies for offering coupons to increase loyalty and satisfaction.

Steps
Feature Selection: Utilize customer demographic features and transactional features for segmentation.
Model Development: Train and evaluate K-Means clustering.
Model Evaluation: Use Silhouette score and Inertia for evaluation.
Segment Analysis: Analyze each segment and make recommendations.
